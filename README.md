SAMVRT AI - Clean Starter (Next.js + Tailwind)
----------------------------------------------

This is a minimal Next.js (14) + Tailwind (v3) starter project created for you.
How to run:
1. Extract the zip to a folder.
2. Open terminal in the folder.
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npm run dev
5. Open: http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- This starter uses Tailwind v3 with classic @tailwind directives to avoid v4/ESM issues.
- If you want me to add branding, custom colors, or convert to Tailwind v4, tell me and I'll update the project.
